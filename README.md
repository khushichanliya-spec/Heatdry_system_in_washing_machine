# Heatdry_system_in_washing_machine
This repository contains the proposed solution, architecture diagram, and concept details for an open innovation hackathon project focused on improving drying efficiency using an integrated heating mechanism.
# Problem
During winter and rainy seasons, clothes often do not dry completely even after using a washing machine’s spin-dry function. Due to lack of sunlight and high humidity, clothes remain damp for a long time, causing inconvenience when clothes are needed urgently.

#Proposed solution
The solution proposes integrating a heating-based drying system inside the washing machine. After the wash and spin cycle, controlled heat removes remaining moisture, allowing clothes to come out fully dry and ready to wear, independent of weather conditions.

#Key benefit
Provides fast, weather-independent drying directly inside the washing machine.
